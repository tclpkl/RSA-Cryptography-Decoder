I created a Big Integer library that can store and perform math operations on integers larger than what C++ integer variables can store. During this process, I ended up using algorithms like the Modular Exponentiation Algorithm in order to efficiently perform math operations with reasonable runtime. I then used this BigInt library to create a program that decodes RSA algorithms encrypted with 128-bit keys.
