# RSA Cryptography Decoder
Developed by Timothy Lin

## About

I created a Big Integer library that can store and perform math operations on integers larger than what C++ integer variables can store. During this process, I ended up using algorithms like the Modular Exponentiation Algorithm in order to efficiently perform math operations with reasonable runtime. I then used this BigInt library to create a program that decodes RSA algorithms encrypted with 128-bit keys. 

The aim of the project was to understand integer overflows and how to workaround them when working with huge numbers such as in encryption/decryption. This project was my introduction into the security space - my understanding of RSA encryption helped much later in my security engineering internship at MathWorks.
